//This program will display n terms of harmonic series and their sum

#include <stdio.h>
//that function is required to concect two strings, solution I had in mind from the beginging was differend but in C is adding numerical value to the string much more complicated than in modern c
#include <string.h>

//define variables

//get user to enter number of terms

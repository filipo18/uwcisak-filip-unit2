# Comunicating app


## Development

--------
We crated traffic lights from arduino kit. I learned basics of programing arduino in modern C, its not hard to understand and I like functions functionality. Prgoraming in bash I repeated coding process for similar things to many times so fuctions are giving me option to have some basics library to make coding faster. I like this topic a lot because it combines some basic electro enginering with coding and when you code something you actually get phyisical touchable result, not just program running in you computer.

**Fig 1.** First mini arduino project - traffic lights, getting familiar with arduino, getting familiar with concept of ports, learning some bascic coding

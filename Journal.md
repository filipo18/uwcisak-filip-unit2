We discussed the problem we need to solve, we got introduced to Hardware and Software. We already outlined some solutions. First one is to use one button to cycle betwen letters and another to comfirm our choice. Second solution was to make letters cycle automaticly and use one button to comfirm choice and other to delete. Third solution we come up with was to sort letters in a grid than use one button to move verticaly and another one to move horizontaly. With long press we woudl confirm our choice.

To revisit for loop homework on arduino I was using programing blocks on tikercad. I needed to make same programs as I did in bash so I didn't explore any new options or better shortcuts to do the same taske. So as far as I can tell now, I don't see any advantage of one langugage over another.

We crated traffic lights from arduino kit. I learned basics of programing arduino in modern C, its not hard to understand and I like functions functionality. Prgoraming in bash I repeated coding process for similar things to many times so fuctions are giving me option to have some basics library to make coding faster. I like this topic a lot because it combines some basic electro enginering with coding and when you code something you actually get phyisical touchable result, not just program running in you computer.

We crated binary counter from 1 to 15 with 4 lights. Before that we learned how we translate from binary to decimal and from decimal to binary. I already knew that from before

Assigned homework was too easy or I understood it terribly wrong. I hope its the first thing. Working on it, I did not encouter any problems, I just crated one IF - statement, copy it 8 times and than edid inputs and outputs according to the table we got.

We worked on logical gates. It simple to understand. I didn't have time to revisit weekend homework so I need to do that tomorrow to test if I really understand the topic. My yesterdays solution was okay, but Dr. Ruben showed us better way to solve it. There is a bit lognger taught procces behind it but code is much shorter at the end.

Contiued working on logical gates. 
To do list:
1. Working on handout Dr. Ruben gave us

We were working on LED counter, with 7 LED lights
Today's to do list was:
1. create table ob outputs
1. based on that table come up with the equations for each LED light
1. Build prototype in tinker cad
1. develop a code based on equations
1. Build mondel with Arduino

I taught I learned how to use logical gates to create equations based on table of outputs we crated. We ran out of time at the end but we finished the code. When I tested the code I was constantly getting wrong outputs. It looks like we have wrong equations for each LED light, but I checked few equations quickly and they looked correct. Right now I don't know what the reason for the wrong outputs is, but I will double check today and try to fix the problem.

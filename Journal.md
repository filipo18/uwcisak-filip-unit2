We discussed the problem we need to solve, we got introduced to Hardware and Software. We already outlined some solutions. First one is to use one button to cycle betwen letters and another to comfirm our choice. Second solution was to make letters cycle automaticly and use one button to comfirm choice and other to delete. Third solution we come up with was to sort letters in a grid than use one button to move verticaly and another one to move horizontaly. With long press we woudl confirm our choice.

To revisit for loop homework on arduino I was using programing blocks on tikercad. I needed to make same programs as I did in bash so I didn't explore any new options or better shortcuts to do the same taske. So as far as I can tell now, I don't see any advantage of one langugage over another.

We crated traffic lights from arduino kit. I learned basics of programing arduino in modern C, its not hard to understand and I like functions functionality. Prgoraming in bash I repeated coding process for similar things to many times so fuctions are giving me option to have some basics library to make coding faster. I like this topic a lot because it combines some basic electro enginering with coding and when you code something you actually get phyisical touchable result, not just program running in you computer.

We crated binary counter from 1 to 15 with 4 lights. Before that we learned how we translate from binary to decimal and from decimal to binary. I already knew that from before. I learned one more way to use modules.

Assigned homework was too easy or I understood it terribly wrong. I hope its the first thing. Working on it, I did not encouter any problems, I just crated one IF - statement, copy it 8 times and than edid inputs and outputs according to the table we got.

We worked on logical gates. It simple to understand. I didn't have time to revisit weekend homework so I need to do that tomorrow to test if I really understand the topic. My yesterdays solution was okay, but Dr. Ruben showed us better way to solve it. There is a bit lognger taught procces behind it but code is much shorter at the end.

Contiued working on logical gates. 
To do list:
1. Working on handout Dr. Ruben gave us
I think I learned how to deal with logical operators. I worked on that already 3 years ago in math class in my old school and I remembered everything by now. New thing I learned is how to come up with equations. THe thing I knew from before is how to check equation outputs with truth table

We were working on LED counter, with 7 LED lights
Today's to do list was:
1. create table ob outputs
1. based on that table come up with the equations for each LED light
1. Build prototype in tinker cad
1. develop a code based on equations
1. Build mondel with Arduino

I taught I learned how to use logical gates to create equations based on table of outputs we crated. We ran out of time at the end but we finished the code. When I tested the code I was constantly getting wrong outputs. It looks like we have wrong equations for each LED light, but I checked few equations quickly and they looked correct. Right now I don't know what the reason for the wrong outputs is, but I will double check today and try to fix the problem.

We started working on real project, creating english input keyboard with 2 buttons
To do list was:
1. Brainsotrm different ideas
1. Choose one
1. Draw it out and put it into readme file under planing or development section
1. Start research
1. Start coding

This lesson I learnd nothing. I had to much ideas but I was unable to focus. Research is actually harder than I though because I don't know exactly what to search for.

This class we contiuniued working on 2 button english keyboard. It was a bit more productive. I learned how to make matric 2D array and interruptions with arduino. I have to idas how to complete the task. I was able to finnsih one, the other one is a bit triciker I will work on that tomorrow and try to figgure it out.

I tried to finish 2d matrix keyboard, but I didn't succeeded. I will try to revisit that problem. For homework I finnished keyboard with normal array. This was a lot simpler and program is working properly.

Today to do list in class was:
1. Find LCD circut in thinkercad and add 2 buttons
1. Build LCD circut with arduino kit
1. Draw a flow diagram for englsih keyboard program uploaded to classroom
1. Create letter to binary conversation table.

Building circuit with arduino kit was not hard, it just took a lot of time. English keyboard program was basicly what we did for homework customized to be shown on LCD display insted on Serial.monitor. I didn't have time to crate conversation table. I will do that next time

Because of my procrastinating I didn't do anything on Saturday so homework for the weekend + school work from week before that I missed fell on Sunday. I solved first 15 questions without problems. Last five were a bit hardeer. After 3 continous hours of coding I started loosing my focus and patience.  I love a good challange but at this point I just wanted to finnish so for questions 6 and 7 I used help from google. I couldn't find solution for 8th problem, because i was searching for solution in coding language so I ask other students for help and solution was purely mathematicalal and obvious. I was able to solve 9th problem because for one of my previsous solutions I already found include <string.h> (which I didn't used for that problem at the end). There is still 10th problem to solve but it was to much computer science for today so I will revisit it tomorrow.

We worked on machine cycle - how RAM and CPU comiunicate
THen we were finshing our porject

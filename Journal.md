We discussed the problem we need to solve, we got introduced to Hardware and Software. We already outlined some solutions. First one is to use one button to cycle betwen letters and another to comfirm our choice. Second solution was to make letters cycle automaticly and use one button to comfirm choice and other to delete. Third solution we come up with was to sort letters in a grid than use one button to move verticaly and another one to move horizontaly. With long press we woudl confirm our choice.
